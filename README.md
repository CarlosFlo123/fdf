# Introduction

The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping. For
example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is a
prerequisite condition to its conquest. As another example, comparing various 3D representations
of an area of high tectonic activity will allow you to better understand these
phenomenon and their evolution, and as a result be better prepared.

# Usage

1. Once in the project directory "make" the executable file.
2. ./fdf test_maps/42.fdf

3. As you can see test_maps/ have more funny maps to render, you can even create yours by creating your matrix, here is a file example:
